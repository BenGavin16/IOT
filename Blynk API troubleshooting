We entered this code through word and found that there was actually an extra #endif included which meant the error would keep persisting until we removed it. When we removed it and saved the library code the error stopped and the code was able to run. However,  the blynk api still would not work as we were unable to connect the yun to wifi at the start of the project. This now meant that our original code that we wrote was being disrupted so we removed the blynk code from the original code.
