Reviewed Existing Content: Identified relevant sections in the document that required updates, focusing on the "Future Iterations" and "Testing Strategy" sections.

Added Machine Learning Section: Expanded the "Future Iterations" section to include details about incorporating machine learning into the traffic light system. This involved:

Defining machine learning and citing GeeksforGeeks for context.
Explaining how it could analyze real-life data (e.g., traffic volume, time of day) to optimize traffic light timings.
Providing specific examples of adjustments during busy and non-busy traffic periods to improve system efficiency.
Enhanced Testing Strategy: Updated the "Testing Strategy" section to describe the testing and debugging processes in greater detail. This included:

Verifying the functionality of LED colors and real-time updates via the traffic light system.
Testing the button's ability to interrupt the system as intended.
Documenting debugging efforts, such as stabilizing the Wi-Fi connection and ensuring correct button functionality.
Used Tracked Changes: All edits were made using Microsoft Word's Tracked Changes feature to clearly highlight the modifications for review and submission.
